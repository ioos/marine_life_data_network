_Note: Stephen Formel will be listed as the `publisher` if he loads the data into the Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) for you and shares to GBIF and/or OBIS._

***For IOOS Regional Associations*** <br/>
All IOOS Regional Association affiliated datasets should include at least one **Associated Party** which lists the proper RA. The RA names must appear the same as they are listed in OceanExpert. This allows the dataset to show up on the Regional Associationâ€™s institutional dashboard. The metrics for all linked datasets will be tracked on this dashboard.

| Regional Association | OceanExpert |  OBIS Institute | [ROR](https://www.ror.org/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Alaska Ocean Observing System  |   |   |
| Caribbean Coastal Ocean Observing System  | <https://oceanexpert.org/institution/16063>  | <https://obis.org/institute/16063>  |
| Central & Northern California Ocean Observing System  | <https://oceanexpert.org/institution/23204> | <https://obis.org/institute/23204> | <https://ror.org/028paz341> |
| Great Lakes Observing System  |   |   | <https://ror.org/036ftwn63> |
| Gulf of America Coastal Ocean Observing System  | <https://oceanexpert.org/institution/18936> | <https://obis.org/institute/18936> |

| Pacific Islands Ocean Observing System | <https://oceanexpert.org/institution/20188> | <https://obis.org/institute/20188> |
| Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System |   |   |
| Southeast Coastal Ocean Observing System  | <https://oceanexpert.org/institution/20875> |<https://obis.org/institute/20875> |

***For MBON*** <br/>
All `US MBON` affiliated datasets should include at least one **Associated Party** which is affiliated with `US MBON`. This allows the dataset to show up on the `US MBON` institutional dashboard. The metrics for your dataset will be tracked on this dashboard and combined with other MBON dataset metrics. This is possible because `US MBON` has an OceanExpert institute which links the various datasets together on the institute page.

*United States Marine Biodiversity Observation Network* <br/>
OceanExpert: <https://oceanexpert.org/institution/23070> <br/>
OBIS Institute: <https://obis.org/institute/23070> <br/>

_Note: Mathew Biddle will be listed as the `distributor` with `US MBON` as the institution._

## Appendix: How to create an OceanExpert institution

Before creating a new institution it's always good to first do a search to make sure your institution doesn't already 
exist in **OceanExpert**. You can search for institutions at <https://oceanexpert.org/advancedSearch>. Be sure to check 
various spellings and acronyms too!

To create an **OceanExpert** institution:
1. Create an **OceanExpert** account: <https://oceanexpert.org/register>
2. Once your account is created, log in and edit your profile:<br> 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8480023/207622140-89c3bbb5-1abd-4058-809b-8434635bfa54.png)
3. In the **Affiliation and Address** section of the profile there is a dropdown menu for `Organisation/Institution/Company`, select the first option `Cannot find my Institute - Create New`: <br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8480023/207622420-52592ce2-bda7-4ba4-a40a-47417ca6bca7.png)
4. A new window will pop up and ask you to populate a new institution record:<br> 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8480023/207622801-e395e6af-dd61-4247-a865-b5a86dcaf787.png)
   1. The only required fields are: `Name`, `Type` (choose from Academic, Government, International / Intergovernmental, NGO, Private Commercial, Private non-profit, and Research), `Address`, `Zip Code`, and `City`.
5. Click **Add Institution**.
6. That should add the institution to the drop down list for `Organisation/Institution/Company` so that you can associate it with your profile.

To edit **OceanExpert** institution pages, send an email to <mailto:info@oceanexpert.org> with the requested changes.

## Appendix: How-to Link OBIS datasets together through an institution page

Once your appropriate institution has an **OceanExpert** record, follow the steps below to ensure the appropriate dataset records are linked to the appropriate institution.

1. In the [OBIS-USA IPT](https://ipt-obis.gbif.us/) metadata, add an appropriate _Contact_ which lists the name of the institution exactly as it is listed on **OceanExpert**.
   1. For example, to link datasets to the [US MBON institution](https://obis.org/institute/23070), in the OBIS-USA IPT, a contact is added with the Organization: `United States Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (US MBON)`.
2. Save and publish the record.
3. The **Data providers** section of the OBIS metadata record should now list the appropriate institution with a hyperlink to the OBIS institution record and OceanExpert ID.

## Appendix: More information on ROR identifiers
NOAA and IOOS DMAC encourage the use of [Research Organization Registry](https://ror.org/) (ROR) identifiers for institutions, but the current implementation of OBIS uses OceanExpert to create the institutional dashboard. For more information about ROR identifiers and IOOS recommendations, see the [August 2024 DMAC tech webinar recording](https://youtu.be/P1WzR0twg_U). The documentation here regarding institution identifiers will be updated with new guidance when advances are made in linking RORs to OceanExpert identifiers and if RORs are implemented in other relevant repositories for IOOS marine life data.
